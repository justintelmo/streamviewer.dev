A single page application that is built with Vue and Laravel

Users may log in with their Google accounts via OAuth2.0, which lets them see a list of currently active live broadcasts on YouTube, sorted by viewers. Once a user selects a live broadcast, they may view and participate in the chat. They may also see current stats of the stream, including the most recent chats.

While I do have some PHP experience, a lot of my experience comes without knowledge of modern frameworks, so I decided to use PHP with a framework that I was interested in learning wholeheartedly. Laravel seemed to stick out as the framework of choice for a lot of modern PHP developers, so I went with that.

On the client side, Vue has been getting a lot of traction lately so I decided to use that to see what the fuss was about. Turns out, it's a pretty darn intuitive framework. Routing and templating were made very simple with this.
